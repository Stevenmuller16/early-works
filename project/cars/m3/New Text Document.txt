The fourth generation BMW M3 was announced on the 2007 Geneva Motor Show (Switzerland, March 6–18th, 2007) with the BMW M3 concept.

As was the case with the E46 M3 Concept and E60 M5 Concept, the M3 Concept had almost nothing of the looks of the production version, that had its world premiere on the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show IAA (Germany, September 13 to 23).

It was originally set to be called M4 along with 3 Series coupes and convertibles that were to become the 4 Series, but due to the interest in retaining the M3 line, this change was scrapped.

Similar to the previous M3 generations that introduced a new engine, the fourth generation M3 did the same: the BMW S65 engine. The S65B40 is a naturally aspirated, high-revving 4-litre V8 that is based on the 5-litre S85B50 V10 that powered the E60/E61 M5 and the E63/E64 M6. It delivers 414 bhp (309 kW; 420 PS) at 8300 rpm,[30] with peak torque of 295 lb·ft (400 N·m) at 3900 rpm,[30] which represents a power increase of 22% over the E46 M3. The engine weighs 15 kg (33 lb) less than the outgoing six-cylinder for a total weight of 202 kg (450 lb). A six-speed manual transmission is standard. As from April 2008, BMW offers a new seven speed Getrag double-clutch gearbox, called M-DKG (Doppel-Kupplungs-Getriebe) or M-DCT (Double Clutch Transmission) as an option, which reduces shift pauses to less than a tenth of a second and shortens the car's 0-100 km/h (62 mph) sprint time by 0.2 seconds vs. manual. It features both automatic and manual modes similar to the SMG gearboxes in the E36 and E46, but with more speed and efficiency.

The E92 M3 coupe inherited a carbon-fiber roof similar to the one used on the E46 CSL. For 2009, the E9x M3 received a model refresh commonly referred to as a LCI (Life Cycle Impulse) by BMW. Those changes included minor interior trim pieces and LED rear tail-lights. Recent testing by Car and Driver magazine has shown that the 2011 M3 equipped with an M-DCT transmission accelerated from 0–60 mph in 3.9 seconds and went on to record a 12.4 second quarter mile time.[30] This is almost half a second quicker than 2008–2010 M3 models with the same engine and transmission.
The M3 Cabrio

The new M3 is again available as a 4-door saloon, based on the E90 3-Series saloon, but unlike the regular saloons, the M3 version shares the coupé's wide and sculpted front end, including headlights. Saloons, however, do not get the coupé's carbon-fiber roof, and are 22 lb (10 kg) heavier than identically equipped coupés.

Although BMW M3 saloon front-end design matches the specific look and high-performance character of the Coupé; the side-sills and rear diffuser are tailored for the saloon. The M3 saloon is powered by the same engine as the other two versions. In 2008, a four-door (E90), six-speed manual transmission M3 accelerated to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 4.3 seconds in a Motor Trend test,[31] matching the performance of the M3 Coupé.

The E93 hardtop convertible version joined the M3 lineup shortly after the E92's launch, and is based directly on the M3 Coupé. The convertible uses a power retractable hardtop which adds 441 lb (200 kg) to the weight of the car, bringing the total to 4,145 lb (1,880 kg) with a negative impact on the convertible's overall performance. The convertible features a special leather surface for the seats that reflect sunlight to reduce the tendency of seats to become uncomfortably hot with the top down.[32]

A CSL lightweight version did not materialize and the M division has stated they did not plan to offer an e9x M3 CSL and had instead focused on producing M versions of the X5 and X6, in a
